# This project is an intro to Postman and Newman

You will need to have NPM, NodeJS and Postman installed in your computer to run this code.

## Getting Started

You will need to do an `npm install` before running the code.  

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the tests cases defined in the *package.json* e.g. `npm run test`

## Please note

The command `npm run test` will create a report.html which you can open in your browser to see the results.
  
The command `npm run test_tasks` will create a report_tasks.html which you can open in your browser to see the results when creating multiple tasks using a csv.


I am using the Dummy API of Todoist, for more info please visit : https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v1/
